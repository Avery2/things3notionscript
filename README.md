# Things3 and Notion Script

A script I wrote that takes todo items in Things3 and writes them to a Notion database.

## Worked

https://github.com/thingsapi/things.py#documentation

https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started

This is the one that worked. It follows the official API so I think it's more reliable.
